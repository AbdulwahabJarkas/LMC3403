## Press Release

**PR Newswire, Atlanta, GA, December 2, 2022.** Today Reflex Inc. announced the launch of Angel, an EMS drone first responder system, that ensures faster response times when it matters most. Angel is designed to save lives by autonomously delivering medical equipment on scene to bystanders and victims to start the first response process before first responders arrive.	

Each year, US Emergency Medical Services (EMS) respond to 240 million 9-1-1 calls. 11.7 million of these are directly life-threatening, where each minute can mean the difference between life and death. Responders widely agree that a response time of less than five minutes minimizes death rates and long-term medical complications. However, the alarming reality is that average urban and rural response times are 8 and 14 minutes respectively, and they can easily reach up to an hour. This is in large part due to understaffing and a resource disparity issue at 9-1-1 jurisdictions.

Angel solves this problem like no other for 9-1-1 jurisdictions. Each 9-1-1 jurisdiction will be outfitted with drones and drone dispatch software. When a 9-1-1 call comes in, the dispatcher can automatically deploy a drone with the press of a button using the drone dispatch software, without deviating from standard procedures. This triggers the deployment process of the drone from the drone hub including finding the optimal path, programming the flight onto the drone, loading the right equipment, filing the flight plan, and taking off. The dispatcher can continue to investigate the situation by following standard protocol, and dispatch EMS following the complete investigation of the emergency. All the while, the drone arrives on scene providing the bystander with the necessary equipment to begin the first response process before first responders can arrive on scene. 

“Angel is a lifesaver,” said Chief John Smith, Chief of Atlanta Fire and EMS. “Both literally and figuratively. We are responding to a higher volume of calls and giving every life the chance it deserves. Angel also gives us the ability to effectively manage our resources, and reduces the stress on the entire EMS system. I cannot imagine operating my team without Angel anymore. If you lead any type of First Response team across the country, you are in need of Angel.”

## FAQ

### **Q:** Is there a cost pushed to the victim like with ambulance services?
Similar to private ambulance companies, Reflex leases the hardware to the jurisdiction, contracts pilots to operate the drones, and provides software on a subscription based model. However, since Reflex will not be directly involved providing care to the victim there is no cost pushed to them. All costs will be directly charged to the jurisdiction.

### **Q:** 9-1-1 jurisdictions are already struggling with their budgets, why should they spend it on Reflex’s services? 

A drone equipped with medical supplies has the unique ability to tackle the long emergency response time unlike ambulances or hiring more staff. Not only are drones a cheaper solution, but they have the unique ability to distribute resources evenly across the jurisdiction.

Drones are automated and can take the shortest path to the victim, and as a result they have the ability to ease stress on the 9-1-1 in a way that ambulances or more staff cannot. For example, if all of the jurisdiction’s resources are actively involved with other emergencies, the drone can be used to provide first response, while the other resources resolve the other issues. More importantly, by adding a drone system, the jurisdiction gains the ability to intelligently determine and plan how its resources may be used at any given time to improve victim outcomes amongst all emergencies. Overall, Angel provides the best value per dollar for a 9-1-1 jurisdiction. 

### **Q:**  What environments can Angel expect to operate in?

Currently, Angel can operate in most urban and rural areas across the United States. There are some limitations where drones can fly due to a lack of cellular reception. Reflex is working on improving drone coverage in these areas. 

### **Q:**  What are the use cases for drone delivery?

The role of the drone is to transport medical supplies to a victim or bystander before first responders can arrive on scene. This means that the equipment should not require any expertise to use. The drone can be equipped with a payload which can include any of the following:
- medical equipment such as automated external defibrillators (AEDs), insulin, naloxone, first aid kits, bleed kits, electrolytes, epinephrine, antivenom, oxygen, morphine, etc. 
- tools such as ropes, radios, floatation devices, batteries, electronics, flare gun, matches, scissors, knives, etc.

### **Q:**  What happens if we lose control of the drone during a mission?

In the case where the drone cannot be controlled or landed safely, as can be determined by the pilot or any technical monitoring system, the flight may be aborted. In these situations, it is important that we prevent further catastrophes. The drone is equipped with an emergency parachute release system that can be deployed automatically and manually to prevent further damage. The parachute will control the descent of the drone to the ground, and the drone can be retrieved after the emergency has been mitigated.

### **Q:**  What kind of drone does Angel use?

The type of incident, the area that needs to be serviced, and the needs of the 9-1-1 jurisdiction will determine the physical profile of the drone. Fixed wing drones may be used to cover more geographical area. On the other hand, a multicopter drone operates more efficiently in smaller ranges. Reflex will work with your jurisdiction to determine what drone profile works best for you.
